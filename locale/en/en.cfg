ltnc-use-stacks=If checked, requests for items will be entered as stacks instead of individual count.\n\n[color=blue]Default:[/color] [color=green]True[/color]
ltnc-negative-signals=When enabled and the combinator is set as a requester, newly created 'Item' and 'Fluid' signals will be made negative.\n\n[color=blue]Default:[/color] [color=green]True[/color]
ltnc-emit-default-network-id=When enabled, a Network ID that matches the LTN default Network ID will not be removed from the combinator.\n\n[color=blue]Default:[/color] [color=green]False[/color]
ltnc-emit-explicit-default=When enabled, you may set a signal to match the LTN default value.  It will not be removed from the combinator if the LTN default changes.\n\n[color=blue]Default:[/color] [color=green]False[/color]

[string-mod-setting-description]
ltnc-disable-built-combinators-none=Neither Requester nor Provider will be forced to a disabled state.  New combinators will have both services remain enabled.
ltnc-disable-built-combinators-requester=The Requester service will be disabled on all new combinators.  This will disable the Requester service in blueprinted combinators even if it is enabled in the blueprint.\n\n[color=red]Note:[/color] Disabled means that a high Request Threshold will be set on the combinator.
ltnc-disable-built-combinators-provider=The Provider service will be disabled on all new combinators.  This will disable the Provider service in blueprinted combinators even if it is enabled in the blueprint.\n\n[color=red]Note:[/color] Disabled means that a high Provide Threshold will be set on the combinator.
ltnc-disable-built-combinators-all=Both the Requester and Provider services will be forced to a disabled state.  This will override settings in blueprinted combinators.\n\n[color=red]Note:[/color] Disabled means that high Request and Provide Thresholds will be set on the combinator.
