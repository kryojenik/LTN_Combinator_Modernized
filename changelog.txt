Version: 2.1.0
Date: 2023-06-23
  Info:
    - ***  There is significant rework done to the logic when placing combinators.  This is
      ***  based on much of the feedback I received after the 2.0 release.  I believe things
      ***  Will be more sane, and more intuitive.  As always, please let me know if things
      ***  need additional adjustments.  I hope I was able to test enough scenarios to cover
      ***  possible pit-falls.  I'm sure some corner cases still exist.  See below for
      ***  Changes.
      ***
      ***  Please back-up your save game and check your combinators before saving over an
      ***  active save game.
  Bugfixes:
    - Several spelling errors corrected in English locale
    - Fix not disabling signal edit controls when modifying stop type creating an opportunity
      to crash when later clicking the confirm button without an active slot (#42, #43)
    - Fix crash when switching entities while LTN Combinator is opening in map view and latency
      to the game server exists.
  Changes:
    - Will not remove signals when converting to depot by default.  Hold Shift when clicking depot
      checkbox to remove Requester/Provider related signals
    - New combinators from blueprints, or copy/paste will follow rules in Mod Settings
    - New non-blueprinted combinators will not auto-disable anything.
    - Replacing standard constant combinators will not auto-disable anything.
    - Rotating combinators by robot will not loose thresholds or disable services
    - Thresholds and service state will be restored on undo up to 1 hour
    - Thresholds and service state will be restored when reviving a destroyed combinator ghost
  Features:
    - Added reset buttons for LTN signals that will clear the signal to use the LTN default (#12)
    - Now able to store a positive signal by holding SHIFT when clicking the confirm button.
    - Will add an alert when placing new combinators that have something auto-disabled based on 
      Mod-settings.
    - Per-user setting to display the network config panel as the default view when opening the
      combinator
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.6
Date: 2023-05-15
  Bugfixes:
    - Added missing locale string help for /ltnc-unset-requester
    - Attempt to avoid an elusive crash bug with some additional validation.
    - Re-fix crash if Network Description Icon is from a mod you removed.  (#5)
  Changes:
    - Added a debug output file in script-out.  There have been a few reports of a crash in
      multi-player that I haven't been able to reproduce, or track down the source.  If these
      conditions present again it will dump some data from this mod to a file and print a message
      on the screen instead of crashing.  If you run into this, please provide the file it creates
      and a description of what you were doing when it happened, who-else was online, if they were
      working with any combinators, anything that could help reproduce the conditions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.5
Date: 2023-05-13
  Info:
    - *** Potential loss of request signals - please check your mod settings        ***
      *** Only impacts users that changed the default number of signal rows pre-2.0 ***
          Apparently setting values are not moved during the migration scripts
          The number of signal rows setting changed names when migrating to 2.0 and reverts to the
          default value of 2.  If you had a larger number pre-2.0, please check your settings
          before loading loading / saving your game.  Making sure the new setting is large enough
          will avoid a loss of request signals.  Version 2.0 defaults to 2 rows of 10 signals while
          pre-2.0 the default was 2 rows of 7 signals.
    - Note on Provider and Requester checkboxes:  LTN does not make a distinction between these two
      functions.  A station will ALWAYS be able to Request and Provide materials.  These
      Checkboxes control the Request and Provide Thresholds.  Disabled (unchecked) and the threshold
      will be set high (2^32-1). Enabled (checked) and the threshold will be as you set it.  Your
      threshold setting will be retained even when you disable a function and restored when you
      re-enable the function.  This will result in a different visual appearance (checked/unchecked)
      than pre-2.0 versions.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash when entering misc signal values outside bounds of signed int (#37)
    - Fixed misc signal input values not getting cleared when confirming or resetting input (#38)
    - Fixed initial item / stacks were fractional stacks (#39)
    - Fixed robots rotating combinators loosing settings (#35)
  Features:
    - Re-added ability to have combinators placed in a "Powered Off" state vs. "Powered On" with
      services "Disabled"  Thanks Dominiquini and Credomane for helping me see the use case.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.4
Date: 2023-05-07
  Bugfixes:
    - Typos correction.
    - Update description for disable service settings
    - Blueprints created in pre-2.0 versions of the mod will now properly retain threshold values
    - Fixed multi-player crash when combinator is removed while someone else has it open.
  Changes:
    - Updated setting names and descriptions for disabling station servers when a combinator is
      built.
    - Updated Mod Description on portal to better explain how disabling services work and why they
      work that way.  If the combinator is off these functions don't work and a station will be both
      a requester and provider.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.3
Date: 2023-05-03
  Bugfixes:
    - Fix crash when pasting after the copy source has been removed. 
    - Forgot datestamp in changelog..  Bumped version as a result
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.1
Date: 2023-05-01
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed 2.0.0 migration issue that can result in lost thresholds when placing blueprints from
      migrated combinators (or copy paste)
  Features:
    - Added a command to "disable: the requester service on all combinators that do not have a
      negative item or fluid signal configured.

      This version of the combinator more accurately reflects how the signals are controlling
      the station.  The previous versions imperfectly guessed how to display requester / provider
      services based on signals that were configured.  Now this check box is more deterministic
      and specifically controls requester and provider thresholds.  Therefore many combinators
      that appeared to be provider only in previous versions now look like the are both 
      provider and requester because there is not a high-request threshold set.

      /ltnc-unset-requester
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.0
Date: 2023-04-30
  Bugfixes:
    - Added close sound
  Changes:
    - Complete rewrite from scratch.
    - The UI has been revamped considerably, but retains general feel.
    - Now using current FLIB library
    - All signals are always visible.  No more hiding parts of the combinator.
    - Likely many more, as well as a few new bugs.  Please report.
  Features:
    - Able to open and paste settings from map and long distance (treat like a train station).
      Note: may interact poorly with RemoteConfiguration Mod.
    - Can disable provider / requester services of the station via the combinator.
      This sends high thresholds into the station and retains the values so they can be reenabled.
    - I'm sure I've added new bugs in this process.  Please report them and any missing features
      or non-intuitive behavior.
  Info:
    - Pulled version 2.0.0 from downloads as it had a major issue that could result
      in combinator setting loss when copy/pasting or blueprinting from combinators created prior
      to 2.0.0.

      This will revert to following the LTN configured default implicitly.
        Note: If the LTN default network is changed, explicitly set combinators will not change
              automatically.
    - Newly built Requester LTN Combinators from blueprints or copy / cut / paste operations will be
      set to disabled by default.
    - Remove some dead code
